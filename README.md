# Matcher Starter Project
An Leiningen/IntelliJ IDEA project that's ready to go with the matcher.

Leiningen is all set up and configured to download the `org.clojars.cognesence.matcher` and `org.clojars.cognesence.ops-search` dependencies.

## Getting a REPL
To get a REPL in IntelliJ/Cursive, go to `Run > Edit Configurations...` and click the `+` icon in the window that appears. Then select `Clojure REPL > Local`, change the name to `REPL` and just click `OK` (you don't need to change anything else).

Then go to `Run -> Run...` and select `REPL`. This will bring up the REPL window in the IDE. You should now be able to right-click on the text editor after making any changes to your file and click `REPL > Load file in REPL`.

There's also a good (official) guide [here](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/repl.html).
